# mouse-click-extension

This is a Chrome Extension that simulates a mouse click at a particular set of coordinates (x,y)

In order to use this extension go to chrome://extensions/ and enable developer mode. After that click on Load unpacked and select the directory consisting of these files. The extension will now be up and ready to use. 

A click on (0,0) would mostly do nothing substantial on most websites. Thus, I have implemented a click on (200,200) which is very easily noticeable as it mostly clicks on a search link on Google search
